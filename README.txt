Python Vocab Tester:

This is a Python vocab tester, which you can set up with a custom dictionary.
It can be used not only for foreign languages, but for anything you want.

Please let me know about any bugs and suggestions are much appreciated.

I am relatively new to Python, so this is a fairly simple project. Feel free to adapt it in accordance with the license.
